I would like to see little project.

a.       Read input data from any http source (you to choose, rss feed, twitter reed...)  every x seconds-minutes
b.       Process data with any rules (modify input value, add additional values)
c.       Put it in the any in-memory database (H2 for example)
d.       by the request in browser show the last 10 entries (no UI, just json) by reading from the in-memody db

Project structure:
   src/
         main/
                java/
                      --here you have class for process and store data, and defined api to show the data
         test/
                java/
                      --here you have test classes for reading data, invoke methods from the ‘main’ classes with data -> read from db -> validate results

Hints:
1) Framework for tests: junit
2) Please, do not spend time for complex processing logic.
3) Java 8
4) spring boot
5) Don’t use hibernate.


Put it in github. Should be runnable from the IDE.
